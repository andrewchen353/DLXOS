LAB4

Q1:
  To run the tests do the following:
    in the os directory: 
      make clean; make
    in apps/example:
      make clean; make; make run
    in apps/example-paging
      make clean; make; make run

Q2:
  The tests are located in apps/example
  Tests 2 and 6 are commented out in makeprocs since they will be raising errors
  To check these test cases just uncomment the area's corresponding to the tests

Q3:
  We are getting a seg fault in MemoryPageFaultHandler
  We believe that the address that is received from the stack is causing this issue

Q4:
  To run the tests do the following:
    in the os directory: 
      make clean; make
    in apps/heaptest-bestfit:
      make clean; make; make run

  I also wrote additional test cases to check Q4. These can be found in the file 
  additionaltests.c which is in the same directory as the heaptest.c.
